# Smishdet
Smishdet is a mobile app aimed at detecting malicious links in text mesages. The user selects the text messages he/she wants to be inspected for malicious links and sends to smishhdet backend which then sends a response containing the results for each link. 

In the backend, smishdet uses the Lookup API of google safe to inspect each url.
